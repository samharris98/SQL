# I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store.
# It includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, customers, and more. 
# Below are the answers to prompts that I used to analyze the data.

SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS FullName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS i
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.*
